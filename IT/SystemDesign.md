# System Design

## ACID - Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability
ensure reliable database transaction. **Atomicity** means all or nothing, **Consistency** means the transaction must follow all the rules and leave the database in a good state, **Isolation** means concurrent transactions are isolated from each other, **serializable** makes transaction run one after another, as if they were in a single file
